# Arithmetic Operators in Python
A=5
B=20
print(A, B)

# Addition, # Subraction, # Multiplaction, # Division
A+B,B-A,A*B,B/A

# Power
A**2,A**3,10**3, # Square,Cube

# // Floor Division Operator
a=22
b=5
a//b
# 4 is Quotient

# % Modulus operator
a%b
# 2 is Remainder

# Whenever (Even Value % 2 =0)
# (Odd Value % 2 =1)
# Ex. we can easily find whether the given value (N) is Even or Odd by [N%2]
